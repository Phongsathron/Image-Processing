function [p, pmax, pmin, pn] = improd(f, g)
% IMPROD is bra bra bra
%   [P, PMAX, PMIN, PN] = IMPROD(F,G) outputs the % element-by-element product of two images, F and G, % the product maximum and minimum values, and
% a normalized product array with values in the range % [0, 1]. The input images must be of the same size.
% They can be of class uint8, uint16, or double. The
% outputs are of class double.

pmax = max(p(:));
pmin = min(p(:));
